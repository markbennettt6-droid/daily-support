<h1>
This isn’t onboarding.<br>
It’s the moment you stop guessing what you need —<br>
and start receiving it, gently, consistently, and without judgment.
</h1>

<p>
You’ve already taken the most important step: choosing to be supported.<br>
Now, this space exists to meet you exactly where you are — whether you’re navigating your own inner world as an individual, holding a team together as a leader, or showing up day after day as a dedicated member who rarely gets asked, “How are you really doing?”
</p>

<div class="quiet-box">
Every message you receive is shaped by what you choose to share here.<br>
Not by algorithms that guess.<br>
Not by templates that assume.<br>
But by real human insight that listens, adapts, and walks beside you — especially when the weight feels too heavy to name.
</div>

<p>
This system doesn’t just send advice. It learns from you.<br>
It notices patterns in your energy, your language, your priorities.<br>
It gently reinforces what’s working — your resilience, your clarity, your quiet courage.<br>
And it helps you release what’s draining you — self-doubt, over-giving, the need to prove your worth through exhaustion.<br>
All of this happens privately. No one sees it. No one scores it. It belongs to you alone.
</p>

<p>
Below are four paths. Each leads to a different kind of support — but all lead to the same place: a life where success doesn’t cost your peace.
</p>

<div class="path individual">
  <h2>👤 I’m signing up for myself</h2>
  <p>If you’re here as an individual, your support will hold space for your whole self:<br>
  — In your <strong>professional life</strong>, it helps you focus on what truly moves the needle, without pretending you have endless energy.<br>
  — In your <strong>mental state</strong>, it names the fatigue you can’t explain and offers relief that doesn’t demand more from you.<br>
  — In your <strong>emotional world</strong>, it reminds you that rest isn’t failure, boundaries aren’t selfishness, and slowing down isn’t falling behind.<br>
  Your daily message will be crafted from your real schedule, your current stressors, and your deepest intentions — so it feels like it was written just for you.</p>
  <a href="onboarding-individual.html" class="btn btn-individual">Begin My Personal Onboarding</a>
</div>

<div class="path leader">
  <h2>👥 I’m the team leader (manager, founder, or coordinator)</h2>
  <p>As a leader, you don’t need more pressure to perform. You need clarity to lead with humanity.<br>
  — When facing tough <strong>decisions</strong>, you’ll receive calm framing that cuts through noise.<br>
  — When pressure mounts, you’ll be reminded of your <strong>inner steadiness</strong> — the quiet strength beneath the title.<br>
  — And you’ll learn to <strong>lead without burnout</strong>, because sustainable leadership begins with protecting your own well-being first.<br>
  Plus, you’ll receive a weekly productivity report that shows what’s energizing your team and what’s silently draining them — so you lead with insight, not guesswork.</p>
  <a href="onboarding-leader.html" class="btn btn-leader">Start Team Leader Onboarding</a>
</div>

<div class="path member">
  <h2>🧍 I’ve been invited as a team member</h2>
  <p>Your leader has already enrolled your team. Now, this is your space to shape your own support:<br>
  — Your <strong>daily pressure</strong> won’t be ignored; it will be acknowledged and met with practical relief tailored to your role.<br>
  — Your need for <strong>personal balance</strong> won’t be treated as weakness — it will be honored as essential.<br>
  — And your <strong>performance</strong> will grow not from stress, but from a steady rhythm that respects your limits and your potential.<br>
  What you share stays private and shapes only your own daily messages — never reported, never tracked, never used against you.</p>
  <a href="onboarding-member.html" class="btn btn-member">Complete My Team Member Onboarding</a>
</div>

<div class="path welcome">
  <h2>✨ I just want to understand what comes next</h2>
  <p>If you’re not ready to fill out a form yet, that’s completely okay.<br>
  This is a safe space. There’s no rush. No performance expected.<br>
  Visit the welcome page to see what your first day of support will feel like — and how this journey unfolds, one gentle step at a time.</p>
  <a href="welcome.html" class="btn btn-welcome">View the Welcome Page</a>
</div>

<p>
No matter which path you choose, your first message arrives tomorrow at 7 AM EST.<br>
It won’t ask you to do more.<br>
It will simply remind you that you’re not alone.
</p>

<footer>
Private. Human. Daily.<br>
Support that meets you where you are — not where you “should” be.<br>
No tracking. No metrics. No surveillance. Just presence.
