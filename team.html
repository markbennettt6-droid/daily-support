<h1>
Your team isn’t broken.<br>
They’re carrying things<br>
no one ever gave them language for.
</h1>

<p>
Burnout rarely announces itself as collapse.<br>
More often, it appears as quiet disengagement,<br>
shorter answers,<br>
less initiative,<br>
and the subtle, internal decision to stop caring as deeply as before.
</p>

<p>
Most people — whether working alone or within a team — don’t need more pressure, tools, or motivation.<br>
They need a place where what’s heavy can be acknowledged —<br>
without consequence, judgment, or performance review.
</p>

<div class="quiet-box">
This service does <strong>not</strong> monitor your team.<br>
It does <strong>not</strong> report back to leadership.<br>
It does <strong>not</strong> translate human experience into metrics, charts, or KPIs.<br>
It exists for one reason only:<br>
to offer each person a quiet, private human presence —<br>
so they feel <em>held</em>, not watched.<br>
Supported, not managed.
</div>

<p>
What you’re about to choose isn’t a product. It’s a relationship.<br>
A daily companion that arrives every morning at 7 AM EST —<br>
not to add to your list,<br>
but to help you navigate what’s already on it with clarity, calm, and compassion.
</p>

<p>
Below are four paths. Each leads to a different kind of support — but all lead to the same truth:<br>
<strong>You don’t have to carry everything alone.</strong>
</p>

<div class="path">
  <h2>👤 I’m signing up for myself</h2>
  <p>If you’re here as an individual, your support will hold space for your whole self:<br>
  — In your <strong>professional life</strong>, it helps you focus on what truly moves the needle, without pretending you have endless energy.<br>
  — In your <strong>mental state</strong>, it names the fatigue you can’t explain and offers relief that doesn’t demand more from you.<br>
  — In your <strong>emotional world</strong>, it reminds you that rest isn’t failure, boundaries aren’t selfishness, and slowing down isn’t falling behind.<br>
  Your daily message will be crafted from your real schedule, your current stressors, and your deepest intentions — so it feels like it was written just for you.</p>
  <a href="onboarding-individual.html" class="btn btn-individual">Begin My Personal Onboarding</a>
</div>

<div class="path">
  <h2>👥 I’m the team leader</h2>
  <p>As a leader, you don’t need more pressure to perform. You need clarity to lead with humanity.<br>
  — When facing tough <strong>decisions</strong>, you’ll receive calm framing that cuts through noise.<br>
  — When pressure mounts, you’ll be reminded of your <strong>inner steadiness</strong> — the quiet strength beneath the title.<br>
  — And you’ll learn to <strong>lead without burnout</strong>, because sustainable leadership begins with protecting your own well-being first.<br>
  Plus, you’ll receive a weekly productivity report that shows what’s energizing your team and what’s silently draining them — so you lead with insight, not guesswork.</p>

</div>

<div class="path">
  <h2>🧍 I’ve been invited as a team member</h2>
  <p>Your leader has already enrolled your team. Now, this is your space to shape your own support:<br>
  — Your <strong>daily pressure</strong> won’t be ignored; it will be acknowledged and met with practical relief tailored to your role.<br>
  — Your need for <strong>personal balance</strong> won’t be treated as weakness — it will be honored as essential.<br>
  — And your <strong>performance</strong> will grow not from stress, but from a steady rhythm that respects your limits and your potential.<br>
  What you share stays private and shapes only your own daily messages — never reported, never tracked, never used against you.</p>

</div>

<div class="path">
  <h2>✨ I just want to understand what comes next</h2>
  <p>If you’re not ready to fill out a form yet, that’s completely okay.<br>
  This is a safe space. There’s no rush. No performance expected.<br>
  Visit the welcome page to see what your first day of support will feel like — and how this journey unfolds, one gentle step at a time.</p>
  <a href="welcome.html" class="btn btn-welcome">View the Welcome Page</a>
</div>

<p>
No matter which path you choose, your first message arrives tomorrow at 7 AM EST.<br>
It won’t ask you to do more.<br>
It will simply remind you that you’re not alone.
</p>

<footer>
Private. Human. Daily.<br>
Support that meets you where you are — not where you “should” be.<br>
No tracking. No metrics. No surveillance. Just presence.
