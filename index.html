<h1>Welcome to Your Personalized Daily Support</h1>

<p>
Before anything else, pause and take a deep breath. This space is created specifically for you — for your personal growth, your emotional balance, and your professional success. Here, there are no judgments, no pressures, and no automation. Everything you read is crafted to resonate with <strong>you</strong> and your unique journey.
</p>

<div class="highlight">
This is not another course, system, or method you have to force yourself to follow.<br>
This is personal daily support for individuals and teams — designed to help you navigate challenges, discover clarity, and grow consistently.<br><br>
Every message is crafted based on what you share, what you express, and the realities you face. Your journey is analyzed thoughtfully, your strengths amplified, and obstacles transformed into opportunities for growth.
</div>

<h2>Here’s How You Begin</h2>

<p>
Below are the three essential paths to start your journey with us:
</p>

<div class="buttons">
  <!-- Personal Individual Subscription $30 -->
  <a href="https://markbennett8.gumroad.com/l/yyjgyc" class="button personal">
    Begin Personal Support — $30 / month
  </a>

  <!-- Team Subscription $250 -->
  <a href="https://markbennett8.gumroad.com/l/uzkgp" class="button team">
    Join Full Team Support — $250 / month
  </a>

  <!-- Onboarding Page with All Subsequent Links -->
  <a href="https://daily-support.vercel.app/onboarding.html" class="button onboarding">
    Access Onboarding & Setup Page
  </a>
</div>

<h2>What Happens After You Click Onboarding & Setup?</h2>

<p>
Once you enter the onboarding page, you will find clear pathways for everyone involved:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Individual Personal Data Form:</strong> This is where your unique profile and daily support preferences are recorded, so every message feels personal and actionable.</li>
  <li><strong>Team Leader Registration:</strong> Capture the leadership structure, responsibilities, and goals, enabling customized guidance to elevate your influence and decision-making.</li>
  <li><strong>Team Members Registration:</strong> Gather essential data for every team member, ensuring tailored messages that support them professionally and personally.</li>
  <li><strong>Team Guidance Page:</strong> A dedicated area for monitoring and supporting the entire team’s alignment, wellbeing, and productivity.</li>
  <li><strong>Welcome & Next Steps Page:</strong> Clear instructions and messages to confirm the start of your subscription, orient you and your team, and ensure nothing is missed.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This design ensures the experience is cohesive, logical, and seamless — everything flows naturally from your initial choice of subscription to personalized daily support for yourself and your team.
</p>

<div class="highlight">
All your progress, inputs, and interactions are reflected in the guidance you receive.  
The moment you start, our system analyzes, understands, and personalizes every message to you and your team members.  
No detail is overlooked, no challenge ignored, and every step is intended to help you feel supported, understood, and empowered.
</div>

<h2>Why This Matters</h2>

<p>
Personal growth and team effectiveness are intertwined. Without clarity and support, both individuals and teams can feel stuck, overburdened, or misunderstood.  
By starting here, you immediately give yourself and your team the structure, guidance, and personalized messages to handle:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Stress and overwhelm in daily life</li>
  <li>Professional responsibilities and leadership challenges</li>
  <li>Emotional balance and wellbeing</li>
  <li>Team alignment, collaboration, and accountability</li>
</ul>

<p>
From this point, every message you receive is crafted to highlight your strengths, guide you past obstacles, and ensure sustainable progress.
</p>

Private. Personal. Human.<br>
No tracking, no noise, no external pressures.<br>
The journey begins here — for individuals, team leaders, and all team members.  
This is the opportunity to experience steady, actionable support that evolves with you and your team.
