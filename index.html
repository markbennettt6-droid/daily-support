<h1>Welcome to Your Personalized Daily Support Journey</h1>

<p>
Congratulations! By being here, you’ve already taken the most important first step: deciding that your growth, your clarity, your emotional and professional well-being, matter.  
This onboarding is your gateway to a daily experience designed to meet you exactly where you are, to analyze your realities, and to guide you towards tangible, meaningful change.
</p>

<h2>How This Journey Works</h2>

<p>
You will receive daily messages tailored to your circumstances — not generic advice, but messages shaped by the information you provide, your challenges, your thoughts, and your personal journey.  
Every word is crafted to reflect your life. Every insight is delivered to make you feel supported, seen, and empowered.
</p>

<div class="highlight">
<strong>Note:</strong> This experience is not a course, not a productivity hack, and not a system you are forced to follow.  
This is human, personal guidance delivered to you and your team — carefully, thoughtfully, and privately.
</div>

<h2>Step 1: Choose Your Path</h2>
<p>
The first step is selecting your path. This will define how your messages are personalized and how your team or you as an individual will benefit the most.

<h2>Step 2: Full Onboarding Details</h2>

<p>
After choosing your subscription path, you will proceed to the full onboarding experience. This is where each user — whether an individual, a team leader, or a team member — is guided to register, provide insights about themselves, and receive personalized messages.
</p>

<h3>Individual Registration</h3>
<p>
The individual registration page allows each subscriber to provide detailed information about their personal life, professional situation, and emotional landscape.  
These insights are used to generate highly personalized daily support messages designed to nurture your mind, body, and spirit, while helping you tackle challenges with clarity and confidence.

  </a>
</div>

<h3>Leader Registration</h3>
<p>
Team leaders register on a dedicated page where they describe their responsibilities, leadership challenges, and team dynamics.  
This information is analyzed to provide daily guidance on leadership clarity, decision-making, stress management, and strategies to keep the team aligned, motivated, and productive.
</p>
<div class="buttons">

  </a>
</div>

<h3>Team Member Registration</h3>
<p>
Team members register individually, sharing details about their work, their role, and their personal challenges.  
This allows each member to receive messages addressing their unique situation — improving focus, productivity, emotional resilience, and overall satisfaction both personally and professionally.
</p>
<div class="buttons">
  <a href="https://daily-support.vercel.app/onboarding-member.html" class="button onboarding">

  </a>
</div>

<h3>Team Management & Guidance</h3>
<p>
Once all team members are registered, leaders can access the <strong>Team Guidance Page</strong>, where you can view insights, track progress, and receive daily leadership support specifically tailored to your team’s dynamics and challenges.

<h3>Welcome & Next Steps</h3>
<p>
After completing registration, the final page in your onboarding journey provides an overview, next steps, and motivational guidance to ensure you are fully set up to benefit from your subscription.  
This page consolidates your personalized experience and introduces you to your daily support routine.

<h2>Why This System Works</h2>
<p>
Unlike generic advice platforms, this system personalizes every message based on the input you provide.  
For individuals, it guides you through personal growth, emotional clarity, and daily habits that produce lasting results.  
For team leaders, it provides actionable insights that improve leadership skills and team performance.  
For team members, it delivers guidance that enhances productivity, reduces stress, and supports professional and personal growth.
</p>

<p>
Each message you receive is analyzed, reflecting your personality, your goals, and your challenges. We highlight your strengths, help you release negative patterns, and offer guidance that drives tangible improvement.  
This is **personalized growth** at its highest level — a support system that evolves with you.
</p>

<p>
Every element of this onboarding is designed to feel personal, warm, and engaging. Colors are chosen to be visually appealing without strain, buttons are sized for clarity yet elegance, and the layout guides the eye naturally through your journey.  
The experience is crafted to **feel like it was built just for you**, inspiring trust, excitement, and a sense of commitment.
